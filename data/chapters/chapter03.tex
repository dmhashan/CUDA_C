\section{Compare performance differences agains matrix size}
	The graph and tables represented in "Chapter 1" was calculated matrix multiplication average execute time agains matrix size. As user inputed data, every average execution time was calculated doing 30 iterations with constant block size (for gpu calculation) was 16. And user defined matrix sizes are 16 32 64 128 192 256 320 384 448 512 576 640.
\section{Compare performance differences agains threads per block}
	The graph and tables represented in "Chapter 2" was calculated matrix multiplication average execute time agains block size. As user inputed data, every average execution time was calculated doing 30 iterations with constant matrix size was 896. And user defined block sizes are 64 128 256 384 512 768 1024.
