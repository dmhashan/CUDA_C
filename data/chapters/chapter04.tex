The CPU and GPU are two very different computing devices, and are meant to handle different types of computation. CPUs have fewer cores that can each handle more work per core and while the GPU has thousands of lightweight cores, making them good for smaller computations that need to be repeated often.

According to above graphs, You can performance calculation like matrix maltiplication with less time using GPU base programs, And data decomposition use for this matrix multiplication, so Shared memory is the best method for like these decompositions
